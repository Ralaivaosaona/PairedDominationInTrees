# PairedDominationInTrees
This repository contains code for computing the paired domination number and paired dominating set in any given tree. The implementations include an algorithm for efficiently identifying the minimum paired dominating set. There are three notebooks: 
1. Numerically solving a system of equations
2. Generating a histogram for paired domination in samples of trees
3. Paired domination of a random tree with visualizations

The code is linked to the manuscript titled "Paired Domination in Trees: A Linear Algorithm and Asymptotic Normality" by M. A. Henning and D. Ralaivaosaona.
