# PairedDominationInTrees
This repository contains codes for computing the paired domination number and paired dominating set in any given tree. The implementations include algorithm for efficiently identifying the minimum paired dominating set. There are 3 notebooks: 
  1- Numerically solving a system of equation
  2- Generating a histogram for paired dominations of samples of trees
  3- Paired dominating a random tree with pictures
The codes are liked the manuscript titled "Paired domination in trees: A linear algorithm and asymptotic normality" by  M. A. Henning and D. Ralaivaosaona.
